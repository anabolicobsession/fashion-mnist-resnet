This project was created as a part of CTU course [Pattern recognition](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/cz/education/bk/predmety/46/83/p4683806.html). It had a final challenge between students.
The one that achivied a better score on recogniziing samples from Fashion MNIST dataset, was higher on the list. I got 7-th place, which is not bad amont more than 100 students
